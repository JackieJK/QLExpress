/**
 * Faster, more accurate, portable alternative to {@link Math} and
 * {@link StrictMath} for large scale computation.
 * <p>
 * FastMath is a drop-in replacement for both Math and StrictMath. This
 * means that for any method in Math (say {@code Math.sin(x)} or
 * {@code Math.cbrt(y)}), user can directly change the class and use the
 * methods as is (using {@code FastMath.sin(x)} or {@code FastMath.cbrt(y)}
 * in the previous example).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * FastMath speed is achieved by relying heavily on optimizing compilers
 * to native code present in many JVMs today and use of large tables.
 * The larger tables are lazily initialised on first use, so that the setup
 * time does not penalise methods that don't need them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that FastMath is
 * extensively used inside Apache Commons Math, so by calling some algorithms,
 * the overhead when the the tables need to be intialised will occur
 * regardless of the end-user calling FastMath methods directly or not.
 * Performance figures for a specific JVM and hardware can be evaluated by
 * running the FastMathTestPerformance tests in the test directory of the source
 * distribution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * FastMath accuracy should be mostly independent of the JVM as it relies only
 * on IEEE-754 basic operations and on embedded tables. Almost all operations
 * are accurate to about 0.5 ulp throughout the domain range. This statement,
 * of course is only a rough global observed behavior, it is <em>not</em> a
 * guarantee for <em>every</em> double numbers input (see William Kahan's <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#The_table-maker.27s_dilemma">Table
 * Maker's Dilemma</a>).
